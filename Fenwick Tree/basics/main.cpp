for a group function f(x, y) = x*y

- calcultes the value of function f [l,r] in logn time
- updates the value of an element in logn time
- requires o(n) memory
- is easy to use and cose in cas3 of multi D arrays

/*

Fenwick Tree is a Binary Indexed Tree(BIT)

it uses a bit array compueted using partitions of powers of 2

The Fenwick Tree stores partial prefix sums in a clever way using binary representation of indices.

we keep on removing the last set bit

fisrt we n33e to build our bit arrsy before we start applying the query or update operation in the inout array
